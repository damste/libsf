Original release was on July 7, 2012.  It
was updated Feb.03.2016, by Rick C. Hodgin.

1) This version is not yet complete.
2) It has known bugs and is lacking
   features.
3) It is also only a single stand-alone
   version at present.
4) Future plans are to make it playable
   across a network.
5) The domain chess36.com was reserved
   at the time for that purpose, but
   has since been abandoned.
6) When I have time, I will address
   these issues.
7) I welcome contributions to the project.
8) Thank you, and may The Lord Jesus Christ
   bless your work and mine unto Himself.
   Amen.

Note:  I wrote this game while taking care
       of my mother when she was at end of
       life due to cancer.  It was coded
       in my spare time from Dec.15.2011
       thru Jan.19.2012.
