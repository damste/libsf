This directory will be home (James 4:15, Lord willing) to a graphical
game tha will run in Windows and Linux.  It will be the the QIX arcade
game from 1981 seen here:

    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdEOH5O2kCo

Additional screen designs, opponents, and other features are planned,
including:

    (1)  Two-player mode (with capture-your-opponent's-areas by cutting
         across them and dividing them into smaller pieces.  You claim
         both, but the opponent must cut across both sections to be
         able to reclaim them).
    (2)  Powered mode (where the QIX drains your power when it touches
         you or a drawn line, rather than immediately ending your turn).
    (3)  Shaped enclosures (which, if captured tightly, provide for
         extra bonus points).
    (4)  Hyperspace jump (allows the cursor to jump immediately to
         another location on the border).

At some future point:

    (5)  Network is planned to be introduced, but will not be included
		 in this initial offering.
