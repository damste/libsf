The LibSF repository contains all source code maintained by the Liberty Software
Foundation (LibSF).  Our talents and skills given back to God, from whom they
came, being used to serve His Kingdom here upon this Earth.  In much prayer and
supplication, knowing that He is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond any

 Liberty Software's 32-bit Exodus Operating System
 Developed mostly between 1996 and 2004, with exceedingly
 heavy development between 1996 and 2002.
 
 Development resumes Sep.11.2015.
 
 Summary:
 A brand new kernel designed from the ground up around
 the i386 architecture. A future ARM port is planned
 under the product name Armodus.  And later 64-bit ports
 are planned to Exodus-64 and Armodus-64.
 
 This product will use no existing free or open source
 software, and will be entirely comprised of software
 written by the Liberty Software Foundation, in service
 to Jesus Christ.

Liberty Software Foundation's "LibSF 386-x40" CPU Project
Mar.09.2015 -- Partially designed, not yet coded

Summary:
A 40-bit extension of the 80386 with much ISA revamping.
Provides 100% backward compatibility with all aspects of
the non-kernel ISA and structures, with the exception of
paging.

Milestones:
Oppie-1 through Oppie-7 have been mapped out.
Oppie-1 has been coded, including emulator, assembler, debugger, and verilog.
LibSF-386-x40 fundamental design has been created.
See the li386-documentation pages.

A tool has been envisioned for writing the hardware:  LibSF Logician.
It is a graphical tool for manipulating fundamental electronic components,
and aggregating them into logic units.

As of Feb.20.2013, it contains The Visual FreePro Project,
which is comprised of several sub-components:

(1) VVM    - The Visual FreePro Virtual Machine top-level program.
(2) OSS    - The VVM Operating System Specific code.
(3) MC     - The VVM Machine Code assembler, disassembler for debugger.
(4) VASM   - The VVM source code assembler.
(5) VDeb   - The VVM Debugger (a compiled DLL).
(6) VDebugLauncher - The VVM Debugger launcher (tells VVM to load the debugger DLL).
(7) Localization - Supporting resource DLLs for English and Spanish.
