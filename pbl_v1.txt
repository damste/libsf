Preamble

    The LibSF Public Benefit License is a Public Domain license
    for software and all other kinds of digital work.

-----
License

    This license releases the software and digital work into the
    Public Domain forever, with the following consideration:

    It is the intention of the LibSF authors that all of our work
    remain open.  We ask you to honor that request and always
    maintain the digital content you have received from us (source
    code, multimedia, and all other forms) in an open manner.  In
    addition, we request that all changes and extensions you make
    to that content also be made available for others to enjoy,
    in the same source code form, with all documentation, just as
    you received it from us, for we are all here upon this Earth
    together, and each of us can help the other grow and prosper.

    We at LibSF offer this content into the Public Domain knowing
    that it can also be taken and usurped for purposes other than
    those the authors desire and state above, so in addition we
    include this warning, a reminder of accountability:

    Each of us was created by God for a purpose.  We have been
    assembled here upon this planet to live and work together for
    the benefit and betterment of all.  God has doled out unique
    and special skills, talents, and abilities, as He has done,
    severally, to each of us.  It must therefore be recognized
    that each of us is part of the full gift of giving unto man,
    and as a body is comprised of many members, each with their
    part, so too are we part of this body of man.

    We have a responsibility and accountability to God for how we
    operate in this world.  We will be judged by that which He's
    given us, and how we chose to use His free gifts.  This
    judgement will come  at the end of our lives.   When we die,
    we will be summoned by name to appear before Him to give that
    account.  We will be naked, and alone, one on one with the
    Creator of the Universe, and we will go through our lives
    point by point indicating what it was we did while here.

    There are two possible paths we will take when we leave this
    Earth.  One goes to God, to judgment, and to eternal damnation
    in an unending lake of burning fire.  The other goes to God,
    bypasses judgment, and then to enter into His eternal Kingdom
    as Citizens of that Kingdom.  The choices we make here upon
    this Earth determine which way we will go when we die.

    Remember this when you choose to use our software in a manner
    inconsistent with our prescribed intent.  And remember this
    in general in your life when you go about your daily affairs.
    What you do is being written down in books, even those things
    you think no one else saw or knows about.  God knows, and He
    has accurate books on the account of your life.

    There is more to this story, however.  A happy ending if
    you'll receive it...

-----
Salvation in Jesus Christ

    We recognize that God is the author of all things, and that
    all things were made through Jesus Christ, and that not one
    thing anywhere was made apart from Him.  We also hold the
    Bible to be the infallible written word of God.  And within
    His teaching, He gives us an account of the story of who we
    are.

    Man was created to glorify God, made in His image, and in His
    likeness, possessing a body, a spirit, and a soul.  Because
    of sin, we died spiritually.  Death entered in to this world,
    and mankind became corrupt, as did the Earth and all of
    creation here upon the Earth.

    All of the wars, all of the hate, all of the killing, all of
    the disease, all of the oppression, all of the strife, it all
    exists because of sin, because of man's sin, and there is no
    way back from that on our own.

    Jesus came to this Earth to set us free from that dead-end,
    and to give men eternal Life again. He came to set us free
    from that nature, and to restore us to the purposes God had
    for us in His creation, though for a time it seems as though
    this is not happening because things upon this Earth are
    only getting worse.  This must happen and is part of God's
    eternal plan.

    All of us have sinned.  To sin means "to miss the mark," and
    it relates to God's perfect Law.  We can test ourselves using
    even some of the Ten Commandments. Have you ever told a lie in
    your entire life?  Even one?  That makes you a liar.  Have you
    ever stolen anything in your entire life?  Even once?  That
    makes you a thief.  Have you ever taken God's name in vain,
    used it as a cuss word?  That's a sin called blasphemy, and
    that makes you a blasphemer before God.  Jesus said if you've
    ever looked upon another person with lust in your heart you
    have committed adultery with them in your mind.  Have you ever
    looked after another person with lust in your heart?  That
    makes you an adulterer.  Have you ever wanted something your
    neighbor has?  That means you covet, and that's another sin.

    Most people by now would be forced to answer yes to several
    of those questions.  So the question becomes:  If God were to
    judge you on Judgment Day based upon His Holy standard, would
    you go to Heaven or to Hell?  The answer for all of us is Hell.

    And that's why Jesus came.  God does not want us to wind up in
    Hell, but He wants all of us to come to repentance, to turn
    from our sinful ways, to ask His forgiveness, so that He can
    save us, and give us new life, restoring us to His Kingdom, so
    that when we die we can enter in according to His legal system.

    Jesus is able to do this because He takes our sin away.  He
    came here to the Earth without sin, and lived a life where He
    never sinned because He was God.  And as such, he was able to
    go to the cross, and voluntarily sacrifice His own life in our
    place.  The punishment for even one sin is eternity in Hell
    per God's perfect standard.  The punishment for all of the
    many sins you've created in your life is that same sentence,
    an eternity in Hell.  But God was able to transfer your sin
    onto His own Son, Jesus Christ, so that when Jesus chose to
    die on the cross, all of your sin went with Him.  Jesus then
    entered into Hell, was crushed by the Father in Heaven for
    the punishment of our sin, and because He was God on the
    third day He rose again.  He now lives forever, and because
    He lives, He is forever able to make that intercession for
    us, meaning that all who put their faith and trust in Jesus
    Christ, and ask forgiveness, will be forever saved.

    This is the message of the gospel, the word gospel literally
    means "good news".  It is that we have hope in Him, and that
    He restores us to eternal life, something none of us could've
    ever done on our own.

    That's quite a gift, isn't it!  And all any of us have to do
    to receive it is simply trust in Him, and confess our sins,
    and ask Him for forgiveness, and begin to live the new life
    He will give us.  It really is an amazing thing.  Far better
    than even the most generous worldly riches -- eternal life!

Living for Christ

    The Liberty Software Foundation was created so that people
    who have come to know Jesus as their Lord and Savior, have
    a place they can go to contribute the fruits of their many
    skills and talents, knowledge and experience.

    It is our desire to give back unto God of all of those
    things He has blessed us with in our lives, so that we will
    bring unto Him a harvest of labor, of righteousness, of
    holiness, all in pursuit of the things He guides us toward
    because of our new nature, the born again nature of the
    forgiven sinner, the spirit nature of our eternal existence.

    The LibSF does not only have the projects it is currently
    working on available.  If you have a project you'd like to
    offer unto the Lord, and it is one where you are willing
    to give unto Him, and unto all who will receive it, the
    full portion of what it is, then by all means please contact
    someone and get the ball rolling.  The Lord is looking for
    men and women to go out into the Harvest Fields, and this
    is one area where we have a Harvest Field.

    Our lives lived for Christ are not only here in works done
    at the LibSF.  Those who participate will be part of a new
    life.  The old has passed, the new has come, and because of
    that new nature, the desire to change all areas of our
    lives is made real.  We seek to be living for Christ
    wherever He places us.  And that means we are constantly
    reaching out to people to share this gospel message with
    them.

-----
Live for Christ

    In all you do, wherever you are, with the people who are
    around you, lift your head up toward the Heavens and know
    that you are redeemed of God, through His Son, Jesus Christ.
    Rejoice in that knowledge and hold Him in your heart before
    all things you will do.  Bring Him into other people's
    lives that they too may come to know His remarkable presence
    in their lives.

    This bountiful harvest is unto the Lord, that He may be
    glorified by our actions here upon this Earth.  He is worthy
    of this beyond measure.

    Give the Lord all you have, and then pray and ask for Him
    to give you more strength so that you can do even more.

    May the Lord bless you, and keep you, forever focused on Him.
    Amen.
