Ideas for spreadsheet enhancements
----------------------------------

Allow for an option to display scientific notation using values
that round to the nearest multiple of 3, or to translate them
into the closest relative units, such as:

	mu -- milliunits
	uu -- microunits
	nu -- nanounits
	pu -- picounits

And so on... that way rather than 1/1000000000 showing up as
1.0E-009, it would display as 1 nu, with the ability to
change the "u" to be some custom character or phrase, allowing
ps for picoseconds, nm for nanometers, etc.
