Ideas for debugger enhancements
by Rick C. Hodgin
-------------------------------

Jan.13.2016 -- Two options:

#1 An option to allow a "Continue Until Another Breakpoint Is Hit" to
prevent the current breakpoint from being hit on every iteration of a
loop, for example.

#2 An augment to the Jan.08.2016 idea of playing a sound, an option
to display an image near the breakpoint line so that it can be parsed
rather than reading the source line.

-----
Jan.12.2016 -- An option to perform a simulated call on a function, which
has its return values and parameters updated by manual settings, with the
ability to maintain a history of values used.  A new Sim-Step ability,
which does not actually call the function, but simulates the call by using
the manually input values.

-----
Jan.08.2016 -- Allow for an option play a sound upon entry/engagement of
a particular breakpoint or codepoint.
