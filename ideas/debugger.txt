Ideas for debugger enhancements

-------------------------------

Jan.12.2016 -- An option to perform a simulated call on a function, which
has its return values and parameters updated by manual settings, with the
ability to maintain a history of values used.  A new Sim-Step ability,
which does not actually call the function, but simulates the call by using
the manually input values.

Jan.08.2016 -- Allow for an option play a sound upon entry/engagement of
a particular breakpoint or codepoint.
