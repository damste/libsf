I wrote this code to go through the logical steps of loading a
class from a VCX manually.  This logic will eventually flow into
Visual FreePro, Jr.  For now, it is just a concept, and a work
in progress, one designed to instantiate an instance of a class.

Some new class features will appear in VJr, such as:

(1) The ability to see the class hierarchy of changed-from-base-
    class-default property values (and they can be accessed at
	runtime using this.Width.child and this.Width.child.child, etc).

(2) The ability to directly edit parent class source code, even if
    that code is already instantiated in other objects.

(3) The ability to strike methods or properties from the running
	instance of the class at design-time, or runtime (all except
	base class properties).

(4) A few more that are currently undisclosed... :-)
