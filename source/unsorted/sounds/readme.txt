I was sitting at home with my family and this thought just occurred to
me ... that it would be possible to encode multiple channels of data
through sound using fixed frequencies on a known period.  This would
produce a combination of frequencies for the sound signal, which could
then be applied against a list of candidates targets for the known
frequencies, which would then allow decoding of the sound signal.

I wrote this little test program this evening to test out the theory.
It is written, but not tested or debugged.  It's late so I'll test it
another day. :-)

I don't know why these things just occur to me.  Sometimes it really
freaks me out.

Best regards,
