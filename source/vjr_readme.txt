===========

Timeline:

Feb.2014 -- Original release. Development cancelled within days.
Jun.2014 -- Resumption of development.
Jul.2014 -- VJr 0.30 included a design for functions so other developers
            could contribute.
Jul.2014 -- VJr 0.39 compiles with GCC in Windows using MinGW 4.8.x.
Aug.2014 -- VJr 0.49 editor with syntax highlighting is functional.
Sep.2014 -- VJr 0.53 major refactoring ... all objects use indexed
            arrays for default/static members.
Nov.2014 -- VJr 0.54 allows spaces in variable names (shift+spacebar).
Dec.2014 -- VJr 0.55 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
Feb.2015 -- VJr 0.56 in source branch (unreleased binary) compiles
            natively in Linux without error. Lin2win emulation layer
            allowing Windows-like code in Linux is under development.
Mar.2015 -- VJr 0.56 in source branch (unreleased binary) references
            to implicit thisCode object (like thisForm) is inserted
			everywhere, in preparation for running programs.  VXB
            compiler is also under development.

It is estimated that VJr will only be about 4 MB in size max for the full
developer version with basic forms/classes/reports IDE, and runtime.  An
additional resource DLL may increase that size somewhat, but it's looking
very strongly like the entire version of vjr.exe when released will be
well under 10 MB, will support 32-bit and 64-bit versions, run natively
in Windows and Linux, and quite possibly Android.
