&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This folder was previously \libsf\vvm\.  It contains the development efforts for the full version of Visual FreePro, and the Visual FreePro Virtual Machine.  It is incomplete, and not even to a usable state despite a very large amount of development being completed on it.  Currently, Visual FreePro, Jr. is receiving development.  See \libsf\source\vjr\ for the Visual FreePro, Jr. project.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The source folder contains all source code for the full VFrP Visual FreePro Project, written by Liberty Software Foundation.  Our talents and skills given back to God, from whom they came, being used to serve His Kingdom here upon this Earth.  In much prayer and supplication, knowing that He is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond any of our needs.  Jesus Christ, our Savior, to Him be all the glory.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Development is currently suspended pending completion of [Visual FreePro, Jr.](https://github.com/RickCHodgin/libsf/tree/master/source/vjr/projects) and [source code](https://github.com/RickCHodgin/libsf/tree/master/source/vjr/source).

Best regards,
Rick C. Hodgin
