-----------

Automated build scripts will be placed here (James 4:15, Lord willing).
These will allow one-click execution of the compile steps to produce
32-bit and 64-bit versions in MSVC and GCC.

It will be these batch files:
	build_all.bat
	build_msvc_32.bat
	build_msvc_64.bat
	build_gcc_32.bat
	build_gcc_64.bat

And they will populate into these locations:
	\libsf_offline\source\vjr\bin\32-bit\vjr_msvc_32.exe
	\libsf_offline\source\vjr\bin\64-bit\vjr_msvc_64.exe
	\libsf_offline\source\vjr\bin\32-bit\vjr_gcc_32.exe
	\libsf_offline\source\vjr\bin\64-bit\vjr_gcc_64.exe

Best regards,
