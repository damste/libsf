*** Welcome to Visual FreePro, Junior! :-)
*** For now, this can be thought of as a command window ... with a twist.
*** It works like an editor window.  You can insert new lines, edit old ones, etc.
*** To execute a command, press F6 or Enter if you're on the last line, or use F6 on any line.
*** You can use ? 999 and ? "sample" in this daily build.
