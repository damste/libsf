The Visual Studio projects are now located in .\projects\
All source code has been moved to .\source\

In order to build Visual FreePro, Jr., load the .\projects\vs2010\vjr.sln.
Select the target (Debug or Release, in Win32 or x64 mode), and then
rebuild the solution.

Rebuilds are very fast (about five seconds).  Edit-and-continue debugging
is fully supported.  Please contact me with any questions from the email
located at http://www.visual-freepro.org/vjr/ ...

May the Lord Jesus Christ bless you in your life as you receive this,
our prior work, given from Him, through us, unto you. Amen.

Best regards,
Rick C. Hodgin
