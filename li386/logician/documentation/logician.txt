LibSF Logician
--------------

This file documents initial ideas for primitive components to be used
as part of the Logician programming language, simply called "logician."

These primitives will be pluggable via a node editor, with a standard
language similar to C/C++ (called RDC) for source code, and for handling
all logic and object processing.

May the Lord guide me and keep me on this project.  I ask for this in
Jesus' name.  Amen.

Primitive types:

	Group		-- An aggregate of things
	Real		-- A physical connection to a real thing
	Talkin		-- A protocoled exchange input for asynchronous design
	Talkout		-- A protocoled exchange output for asynchronous design
	Talkback	-- Bi-directional asynchronous communication
	Trigger		-- A signal with logic
	Signal		-- A bitline for I/O
	Data		-- A bitline grouping for I/O
	Regs		-- Data storage aggregates for I/O
	Code		-- A logic block
	Clock		-- A synchronous clock
	History		-- A history of values
	Delta		-- A history of changed values
	Vent		-- A debug port (with asynchronous pause)
	Clone		-- Clones a Signal or Data
	Sticky		-- A sticky bit with set, reset
	Debug		-- Pipes a Signal or Data to a debug panel
	Away		-- Creates a connection to a remote thing

Fundamental types:

	Invert		-- A logical NOT for Signal or Data
	Any1		-- A logical OR for Signal or Data
	All1		-- A logical AND for Signal or Data
	Diff1		-- A logical XOR for Signal or Data
	Any0		-- A logical NAND for Signal or Data
	All0		-- A logical NOR for Signal or Data
	Diff0		-- A logical XNOR for Signal or Data
