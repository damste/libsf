The utils folder contains all source code whose sole existence is as part of a shared utility among many projects, not specific to a single project, written by Liberty Software Foundation.  Our talents and skills given back to God, from whom they came, being used to serve His Kingdom here upon this Earth.  In much prayer and supplication, knowing that He is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond any of our needs.  Jesus Christ, our Savior, to Him be all the glory.
