Several years ago I began porting Exodus to Bochs so I could run it
in a virtual environment to which I had full control.  Exodus is so
small and fast that it runs amazingly well in this environment.

The version of Bochs available at that time was 2.3.5.  I have no
plans to port it forward to newer versions of Bochs because this
version has been heavily modified by me to support MoMo and VeMo,
which allow named pipe communication between two or more running
processes, which basically act as monitors allowing display output
and mouse/keyboard input.

Best regards,
