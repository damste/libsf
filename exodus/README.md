This folder contains all source code for the Exodus 32-bit operating system authored by Liberty Software Foundation from 1998-2002, and off-and-on since that time, with full development resumed on Sep.10.2015.  Our talents and skills given back to God, from whom they came, being used to serve His Kingdom here upon this Earth.  In much prayer and supplication, knowing that He is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond any of our needs.  Jesus Christ, our Savior, to Him be all the glory.

ExoduS/2 and ArmoduS/2
---

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;x86-based and ARM-based kernels designed to support many of the features seen in OS/2 Warp, including its fully object-oriented Workplace Shell.  It is the goal of LibSF to develop Exodus and Armodus as before, but with these OS/2-like features added in, to revamp them into ExoduS/2 and ArmoduS/2, which I may simply rename Exodus/2 and Armodus/2 so as to drop the upper-case "S" at the end.  However, they will be referred to internally as ES/2 and AS/2.
